This application is designed to add, update and delete Customers and Appointments
from a MySQL database through a GUI. It also provides the user with three reports. Includes
language support for French-speakers.

Instructions:

Upon program launch provide a User ID (test) and Password (test) to login. You will receive a pop-up stating whether or not you
have any upcoming appointments in the next 15 minutes.

From the main screen, you are able to view, create, update and delete both appointments 
and customers.

NOTE: All appointments must be scheduled between Monday and Friday, 8 A.M. to 10 P.M. EST.
NOTE: Deletion of a customer also deletes their relevant appointments.

To access the reports, click the "Report" button at the bottom of the screen.
